	<h1>Time & Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity describes how the runtime of an algorithm changes with input size, indicating its efficiency. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, handling larger inputs faster.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as the input size grows. An algorithm with complexity O(n) requires memory proportional to the input size, n</p>
